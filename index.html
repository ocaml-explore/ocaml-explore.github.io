    <h1>Explore OCaml</h1>
<p>One of the biggest problems programming languages face in a real world setting is that getting started with them isn't necessarily easy. OCaml is no exception. There tend to be lots of great resources explaining interesting aspects of the language like GADTs or the module system - but not as many centred around productivity workflows i.e. getting things done in OCaml.</p>
<p>Often these workflows are obvious... once you know them. Explore OCaml hopes to be a centralised source for workflows in OCaml categorised by user, tools and libraries with rich linking to external sources of information.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here are some of the common problems users face:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm running the <code>ABC</code> operating system, how do I get started with OCaml? (In particular the Windows experience).
</li>
<li>I want to build a library that does <code>X</code>, what is the best workflow* for achieving this?
</li>
<li>I just want to run some <em>Hello-World</em> examples and get started with OCaml - how do I do this? (similar to 1)
</li>
<li>I've noticed a bug in library <code>Y</code> - how do I fix it and contribute to the original library?
</li>
<li>OCaml seems to have many backends - <em>x86, ARM, RISC-V, JavaScript</em> - but how do I use them?
</li>
<li>There is a cool tool written in OCaml - how do I install and use it?
</li>
<li>I'm running on OS <code>ABC</code> but want to compile for <code>XYZ</code> - can I do that in OCaml?
</li>
</ol>
<p>*<em>workflow: this involves testing, publishing, formatting, building etc. all of the common tooling that needs to be in place to allow most programming languages to solve real world problems.</em></p>
<h1>Opam</h1>
<hr />
<p>Opam is the the OCaml package manager. A sharp distinction is made between opam files and the opam client. The former is necessary <em>for any project</em> if you want to unlock the power of the OCaml Platform. Even if you are not publishing your project to the opam repository for others to use. The latter is an optional, but highly recommended client for managing dependencies, package installation etc.</p>

<h1>Workflows</h1>
<hr />
<p>Below are three lists: archetypical users, meet the tools and community libraries. All workflows have one or more users in mind with most using a tool from the OCaml Platform. The community libraries are popular projects which have become standard for certain workflows.</p>
<p>To get started with workflows, open the user that best describes you and start exploring!</p>
<p><a href="Explore%20OCaml%20294d4a6975e84e509cdc53dc6cb1ba3b/Archetypical%20Users%20e3ac9b12886f4eb382d8d03da27ab6ff.html">Archetypical Users</a></p>
<p>The OCaml Platform is a collection of tools that allow programmers to be productive in the OCaml language. Different tools accomplish different workflows.</p>
<p><a href="Explore%20OCaml%20294d4a6975e84e509cdc53dc6cb1ba3b/Meet%20the%20tools%20c2a8723e00364f7b84870dd39706de39.html">Meet the tools</a></p>
<p>Community libraries are recommendations for additional tools to help create your OCaml projects - whilst not part of the platform, many of them have become common use and an understanding of how they work can help you form good decisions for your own project.</p>

<h3>Getting started on:</h3>

<p>Brief guides on getting started on the three most common operating systems. There are a few <em>gotchas</em> to look out for and alternative ways of doing things with explanations as to what is going on. Start with <strong>common</strong> for a quick review of the problem we're trying to solve.</p>

<h2>Notes &amp; Misc.</h2>
<hr />
<p>Understanding how these tools came to be requires and understanding of how the OCaml Ecosystem has evolved. This includes tools like <code>ocamlbuild</code>, <code>ocamlfind</code> and <code>jbuild</code>. Many sources of documentation and tutorials still reference some of these out-dated tools and some of the modern platform tools directly use them.</p>

<p>The OCaml Platform is an idealised, one-stop-shop for all things OCaml. But it too has evolved over time and changed direction.</p>

<h3>TO BE REMOVED:</h3>
<hr />
<p>I'm using this <em><strong>thoughts</strong></em> page for content that may eventually make its way to an FAQ of sorts. The idea is if you're confused whilst writing a workflow then you can document it in this page. Further reading contains additional resources that some workflows might reference for the sake of staying concise.</p>
