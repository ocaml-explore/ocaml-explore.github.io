# MacOS

The defacto system package manger for MacOS is [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). As already mentioned, the main job for an OS package manager is to install libraries for you to use. These are prebuilt so the process tends to be quick. The following line can be run from the terminal to get homebrew installed.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

From here it should be as simple as running: 

```bash
brew install opam #Â Get the latest stable version of opam
opam init # See opam page for what this does
opam switch create 4.10.0 # build 4.10.0 compiler from source
```
