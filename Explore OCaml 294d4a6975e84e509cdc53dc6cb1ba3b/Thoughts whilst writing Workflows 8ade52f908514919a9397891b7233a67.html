    <h1>Thoughts whilst writing Workflows</h1>
<ol>
<li>If I'm building a new project (<strong>not opam</strong>) and I am adding CI there is no tool for installing just the dependencies I want from the dune file. <code>dune external-lib-deps --missing @@default</code> gets you part of the way there but not fully.
<ul>
<li>Will <em>duniverse</em> solve this problem? Should <em>dune</em> be able to install the relevant opam packages and ask about OS system ones?
</li>
<li>What does the opam-dune story look like, how tightly integrated will the two become? What jobs do they do - initialisation of opam files in dune?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The goal, as far as I can tell, is to unify the platform with the <code>opam</code> metadata file with its key use of versioning to support powerful compatability.
<ul>
<li>This doesn't mean using the opam client (although it might be strongly recommended) - for new people is this confusing to have a metadata file called <em>opam</em> even if I'm not publishing it? Perhaps this is like asking whether I need the <code>package.json</code> file if I'm not putting it on <code>npm</code> - in which case it isn't so much of an issue.
</li>
</ul>
