## User Description

---

People teaching OCaml (or any PL for that matter) have one of the toughest jobs. They will likely have to support multiple operating systems (Mac, Unix, Windows...) whilst at the same time trying to ensure a smooth onboarding to the OCaml ecosystem for everyone. 

In addition to this, they will likely require systems for automatic marking and also a mixture of code and textual answers.
