## User Description

---

End users want to solve problems using tools built in OCaml. They want to have the software up and running on their machine as quickly as possible, bypassing all of the tooling and extra features the Platform has to offer. Some examples could be the [flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) static type checker for Javascript or the [Irmin](https://irmin.io/) command line tool.
