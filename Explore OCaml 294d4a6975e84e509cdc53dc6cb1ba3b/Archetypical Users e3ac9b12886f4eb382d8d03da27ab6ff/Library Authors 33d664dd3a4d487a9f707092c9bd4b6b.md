## User Description

---

Library authors build code that is consumable by others whilst also using other people's libraries to build their own.

Ultimately they deal with dependencies, versioning, publishing, testing etc. Building open-source libraries also incorporates general "code hygiene" problems like formatting. Library authors touch nearly *all parts of the OCaml Platform.*
