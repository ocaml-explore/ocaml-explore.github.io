  </details><h2>Overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>Getting started with a project should be simple - ideally a single command would initialise some kind of wizard to guide you through setting a project up. Much like the <code>npm init</code> command which takes answers to populate the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<p>This is important because it is very easy to make mistakes in setting up a repository for a new project and the ideal workflow for a library author would to start writing code almost immediately.</p>
<h2>Recommended Workflow</h2>
<hr />
<p>Dune is the best tool for doing something like this (although AFAIK there's no out-of-the-box support for initialising this with opam integration).</p>
<p>Dune Terminology:</p>
<p><a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html?highlight=%22installed%20world%22#terminology">Overview - dune documentation</a></p>
<p>The key ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>package</strong> - a package is a set of libraries, executables, â€¦ that are built and installed as one by opam.
</li>
<li><strong>project</strong> - a project is a source tree, maybe containing one or more packages
</li>
<li><strong>workspace</strong> - the workspace is the subtree starting from the root. It can contain any number of projects that will be built simultaneously by dune.
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>dune init</code> can be used to quickly add new projects, libraries, tests, or executables without having to manually create dune files, or it can be composed to programmatically generate parts of a multi-component project.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>All in all I think the terminoloygy and documentation is a little confusing for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The terms are all quite overloaded and finding the terminology page on the <em>readthedocs</em> page is not easy... for instance &quot;I want to build a new OCaml project&quot; <code>===</code> &quot;I want to build <em>a source tree containing one or more packages which can be built and installed as one by opam&quot;</em>?</p>
<p><a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Welcome to dune's documentation! - dune documentation</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the definition of <strong>package and then reference in project</strong> it feels like there is a very tight coulpling between opam and dune. Whilst there is a good integration I believe the two are flexible enought to use separately, and powerful when combined.</p>
</li>
</ol>
