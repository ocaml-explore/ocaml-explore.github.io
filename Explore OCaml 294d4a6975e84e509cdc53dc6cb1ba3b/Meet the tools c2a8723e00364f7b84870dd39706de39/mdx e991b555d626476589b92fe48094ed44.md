The excellent book for learning OCaml, [Real World OCaml,](https://github.com/realworldocaml/book) uses mdx extensively to automate their book and ensure the code snippets included within are correct. Code is written in an *examples* directory and mdx keeps the examples and embedded code blocks in the content of the book synchronised.
