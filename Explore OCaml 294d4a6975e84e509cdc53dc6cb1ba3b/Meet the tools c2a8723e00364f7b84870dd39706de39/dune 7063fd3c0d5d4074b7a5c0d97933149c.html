<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>Dune is a build tool that has been widely adopted in the OCaml world - it plays nicely with lots of other tools like opam and mdx. The documentation is very thorough - but do checkout the <em>key concepts</em> to get a high-level overview of how dune works and how to get started building your OCaml project.</p>
<p><a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Welcome to dune's documentation! - dune documentation</a></p>
<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Compositional Builds</strong></h3>
<p>Dune builds projects in a modular way generally based on file structure. This is somewhat different to say how <code>npm</code> would build Javascript projects more or less only based on the <code>package.json</code> at the root of the project. Looking at <em>Typical Project Layout</em> the compositionality is portrayed by the <code>dune</code> files in each directory. Each part is doing something different (building tests, the library, the unix version of the library etc.).</p>
<h3>Declarative</h3>
<p>Unlike say <code>Makefiles</code>, dune is declarative. You tell it what you want and dune handles the nitty-gritty details but provides escape-hatches and <strong>a lot of customisability</strong> in your <code>dune</code> file to build complex projects.</p>
<p>This allows dune to be a great build tool no matter what your project size or complexity is.</p>
<h3>Typical Project Layout</h3>
<p>The following file structure is taken from <code>ocaml-yaml</code> and has been trimmed to show only the relevant dune-related parts and still be readable.</p>

<h2>In the Wild</h2>
<hr />
<p>Dune is used in a lot of OCaml projects thanks to its flexibility, integration with opam and lightweightness. Below are just a few projects using</p>
